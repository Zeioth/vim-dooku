# vim-dooku
(Highly customizable) Documentation generator(s) for VIM.

## What is this
This project is not a single project. Instead, you download only the documentation generators you need.

### Adventages of this approach

* Easier to maintain: [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
* Easier to hack: Having each plugin self-contained, make it easier to fork and modify.
* Common codebase: All plugins share the same architecture, and most options.
* Together but not mixed: There is an adventage in keeping the same options for different documentation generators separated. This allows heavy customization.

### Disadventages of this approach

* Oh no, I have to install 3 plugins instead of one.
